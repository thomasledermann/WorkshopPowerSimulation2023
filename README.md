Workshop Power Simulation 2023

This workshop is a basic introduction to power siumulation. I will demonstrate the estimation of power for specific effects and the determination of samples sizes required for a simple cross-lagged model with 2 time points.

The solution presented uses the free-software R (https://www.r-project.org/), which can be downloaded from https://cloud.r-project.org/
